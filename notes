Infrastructure as Code

When Cloud computing started booming there was a need to automate the infrastructure creation, tools like Terraform helps us to achieve this goal. IAC helps to write human readable code to create a computer based infrastructure. This helps to solve many issues with scaling the infrastructure, speed of delivery, reducing human manual configuration errors and more efficient and cost effective(less people need to manage infrastructure). 

Observability

When we are moving from monolithic to micro service environment, there is a need to monitor this multi service environment.there is a need to monitor this multi service environment and the communications between them. From my personal experience when I worked in micro service migration of Bixby(Samsung Bot) from Ec2 to Kubernetes I have configured Kiali to monitor the Cluster Service Mesh and used Istio to manage the Ingress and Envoy Proxy. Which helped me to observe and manage secure encrypted communication in between the micro services. 

AWS Security

I will be checking below 3 things first

1. Security Groups(mainly Databases) which are open to public, when it comes to Security groups we should restrict it from public access and allow only to specific IP addressi/ranges which is recognized. Plus the Network Access Control Lists and Reduce the Ingress access to specific IP and ports in a VPC.

2.Cloud Trail : I will make sure Cloud Trail is enabled so that we can have a close look on API access to our AWS accounts.

3. Making sure Private Subnets and Private buckets: Unless its necessary make sure you run your S3 buckets in private and your instances or EKS clusters in Private Subnet. For S3 if its enabling public, make sure to guard it with bucket policy and for Private subnets, we can use NAT gateways to communicate from instance to the outside world
